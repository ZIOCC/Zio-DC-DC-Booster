# Zio-DC-DC-Booster

Description


The Zio DC-DC is an adjustable voltage booster that can take a 3.7v to 10v input and boost any higher voltage between 5v and 12.5v.

The board features four connectors (one set of screw terminals, two JST PH connectors, and a micro-USB connector) on the input bus, and a set of screw terminals and PTH pads for the output.

Output voltage is adjusted using a potentiometer that can be adjusted with a Phillips or 2mm flathead screwdriver. The 24-segment (3 seven-segment digits and three decimal indicators) display can be toggled using a momentary switch to show the input voltage or output voltage, and a second momentary switch toggles the output on and off.

Note: This board can only boost, and doesnâ€™t have the ability to regulate the input to lower voltage.
